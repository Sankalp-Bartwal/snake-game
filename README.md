# snake-game
This is a python based classic snake game. It is made using the standard tkinter library, tkmacosx and the standard random library.
The game uses an additional library called tkmacosx. So you will need to download that before running the game.
After downloading the library you can run the game with the following command in terminal or commandline:
python3 snakegame.py
Make sure you type this command in the folder that contains the file.
